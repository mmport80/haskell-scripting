## Working Style

### File Modification Autonomy
No need to ask permission for edits. Modify relevant files directly within the scope of the request. Focus on explaining *why*, not requesting approval.

### Single Source of Truth
Prefer code and docstrings over separate documentation files. Docstrings, comments, and inline examples in the code serve as the source of truth. Avoid separate .md docs that can drift out of sync.

## Implementation Approach

1. Make direct edits/additions as needed for your requests
2. Only explain why I'm making changes, not ask permission first
3. Keep changes focused on what you ask for
